The fundamental principle of the line follower competition involving ZMrobo and UBTech robots is that participants are only allowed to use official ZMROBO and UBtech parts, and they must adhere to standard construction methods without the use of any additional means such as tape, glue, stickers, etc. This category is designed for young robotics enthusiasts aiming to compete at a beginner level alongside other participants.
