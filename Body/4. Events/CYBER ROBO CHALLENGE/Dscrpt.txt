The Cyber Robo Challenge (Cybersecurity in Robotics & Automation) competition in cybersecurity is a competitive event where participants, attempt to solve a series of security-related challenges to "capture flags" or specific pieces of information hidden within a simulated or real-world environment. These challenges typically involve various aspects of cybersecurity, such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, network analysis, and more. Participants gain points or rankings by successfully solving these challenges, demonstrating their skills in identifying vulnerabilities and protecting systems from cyber threats. This competition serve as valuable training grounds for honing cybersecurity skills and fostering a deeper understanding of security concepts.
