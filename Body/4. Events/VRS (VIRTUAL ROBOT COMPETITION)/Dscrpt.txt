Virtual Robot Simulator (VRS) is a computer-based software or system that emulates the behavior and environment of physical robots, allowing users to design, test, and simulate robotic operations without the need for actual hardware. It serves as a virtual platform for developing and experimenting with robotics applications, enabling engineers and researchers to refine algorithms and control strategies before deploying them to real-world robots.
